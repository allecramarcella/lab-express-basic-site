            <p>There is <span>a lot</span> to say about Arnold. Like.....he has a funny accent, was born in Austia, is a former politician, cheated on his wife with the cleaner, is a very famous actor, has a daugther who wrote a book about her skinny <i>but</i> curvey body….but the most inevitable thing to mention is of course his <span>(big) muscles</span> gained during his professional bodybuilder career.</p>
